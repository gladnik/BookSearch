BookSearch
==========
**Book Search** is a simple C# application for text search in the physical books.

The user is required to scan the barcode of the book and spell the request. If the electronic version of the book was found, BookSearch will perform a search for requested phrase. It will show the number of matches, page preview and page number for the query.
