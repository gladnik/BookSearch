BookSearch
==========
Book Search is a simple C# application for text search in the physical books. It was made for the final projects of AI and VR courses at the National Taiwan University.

The user is required to scan the barcode of the book and spell the request. If the electronic version of the book was found, BookSearch will perform a search for requested phrase. It will show the number of matches, page preview and page number for the query.
